# Hi there! Message from the creator

Tomoko here, and I'm the creator of the Zora Project, a passion project of mine surrounding my creation: Zora

Zora is basically an "Operating System", or more like a game that acts like one, kinda like a sandbox game :3

Zora-DS (Disk System) was the first of the Zora product line and its code has been used in literally every Zora project ever sense, however because of how important it is, I've actually decided to make it open-source so that people can learn from it and maybe even create their own programs with it.

*Of course please follow the licnese guidelines both the one included in the documents and the one included with the respritory*

And again, everything here is ***free*** (*free* as in freedom and of price I'm not charging for this qwq)

Again, glad I could make things clear, goodbye now!
